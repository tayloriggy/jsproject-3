Project 3: Build a number-guessing game.

Requirements:

-Create a Github repository for this project. 
-A user has three tries to guess the number, between 1-100, that the computer picked.
-Whenever they guess, let them know if their guess is too high, or too low.
-After their third guess, reveal the number the computer chose to them, and let them know if they got it right or wrong.
-Use an HTML form to create an input input field for the user to enter their guess
-Add a "Submit" button to the form, and use the "onsubmit" attribute to call your JavaScript function.
